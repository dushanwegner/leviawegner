					<description><![CDATA[An amazing treat to finalise your dinner? The perfect breakfast pastry? Well, this is the recipe for you. But don't take my name for it, try it yourself!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the many rumours revolving around this pastry from the <strong>USA</strong>, there is one tale that is most widely accepted. Allegedly, a baker in Boston got mad and tossed a batch of unfinished rolls in the oven. You can imagine everyone&#8217;s surprise when the result was so absolutely delicious. Of course, dinner rolls can be enjoyed at any time of the day. Be it a roll with jam and butter for breakfast or a honey-topped roll for dinner.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>240ml Soy Milk</li>
<li>1 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>60g Ghee</li>
<li>400g Wholegrain Flour</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Topping</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Tbsp Ghee</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Honey</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Warm the soy milk and mix in the sugar.</li>
<li>Take the soy milk off the stove and crumble in the yeast. (notes)</li>
<li>Let the yeast proof for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Rub the Ghee into the flour until obtaining a crumbly texture.</li>
<li>Crack one of the eggs into the flour and add in the yeast mixture.</li>
<li>Use a fork to stir until a dough starts to form.</li>
<li>Start kneading with your hands.</li>
<li>Tilt the dough onto a clean surface and keep kneading.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Punch the dough down and divide it into about 14-16 pieces.</li>
<li>Place the rolls into a square glass tray and let them rise for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC.</li>
<li>Beat the egg with a fork before using a pastry brush to apply the egg-wash to the pastry.</li>
<li>Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden on top.</li>
<li>Melt the butter and mix in the honey.</li>
<li>Separate the rolls from each other.</li>
<li>Brush with honey topping and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Everyone knows brownies, but there are several things about them you might not know. Check out this post for further insights on this treat and the recipe for it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brownies are always linked to the <strong>USA</strong>. The treat is known for its rich chocolate flavour and crispy outside with a soft interior texture. Despite how popular they are, many people wonder where the brownie first came from. So much so, that people have put together <a href="http://www.newenglandrecipes.org/html/brownies.html">compilations of mentions of brownies</a>. Brownies are said to have first appeared in the early 20th century, more specifically, in of Fannie Farmer&#8217;s cookbook in 1896. The original brownies were very different from what we perceive as brownies today. They did, in fact, not contain any chocolate and were flavoured with molasses. The chocolate first found its way into the mix in 1898 when the Kansas City Journal mentioned them. From there on, chocolate brownies started appearing all over in advertisements and bakeries. The first mention of chocolate brownies in a cookbook was in 1899 in the Machias Cook Book. The there featured recipe is much more similar to the one we use today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like brownies, blondies originated in the <strong>USA</strong>. Did you know, the 22nd of January is a day dedicated to celebrating this delicious treat. Even though you might think that blondies and brownies are similar just with different chocolates. Well, not quite. Brownies are known to have a crispy exterior. Blondies, on the other side, are known to be more alike fudge. They are soft and chewy and extremely sweet. The first brownies, made with molasses, are nearly identical to those we now call blondies. So, it seems, all this time we have been thinking wrongly of this desert. They are not derived from brownies. We&#8217;ve given the wrong treat all the credit.</p>

<li>240g Powdered Sugar</li>
<li>80g Caramel Sauce</li>
<li>30g Heavy Cream</li>
<li>30g diced Toffee</li>
</ul>
