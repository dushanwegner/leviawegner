					<description><![CDATA[These crispy spheres with a bit of nutmeg flavor are the perfect snack. Whether you enjoy them with a dip, coated in sugar or pure, they carry an amazing flavour.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Food in <strong>Nigeria</strong> is often fried. So are these. These fried yeast-dough spheres are found in variations all over the African continent. For my collection I chose the Nigerian variety because the ingredients are so simple and pure. Rolled in sugar and served as is or with a freshly prepared strawberry dip this is the perfect soul-food snack.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>250g Flour + extra for surface</li>
<li>300ml Water</li>
<li>1/2 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>1tsp Nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
<li>50g Sugar + 1Tbs for yeast</li>
<li>Oil for deep frying (notes)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Warm the water and stir in the sugar until disolved.</li>
<li>Crumble the yeast into the water and stir well.</li>
<li>Let the mixture proof for 5-10 minutes. (notes)</li>
<li>Sift the nutmeg, salt, sugar and flour into a large bowl.</li>
<li>Pour in the yeast mixture and stir with a fork until the texture thickens.</li>
<li>Start kneeding with your hands.</li>
<li>Tip the dough on a clean, slightly floured surface and continue kneeding until it is no longer sticky.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for 30-60 minutes or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Heat the oil and form little balls of dough before dropping them into the oil.</li>
<li>Stir them well so that they get a nice colour on all sides.</li>
<li>When the puffpuff are a golden-brown colour, use a ladle to remove them from the oil.</li>
<li>Place them on a piece of kitchen paper to soak up the oil.</li>
<li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p>Deep Frying: You do not need any special equipment for deep drying. It is possible to just use a large pot filled with enough oil so the pastry is floating. You will be needing a ladle to pick the pastry out of the pot. The oil can be filtered after letting it cooled down. I usually use a coffee filter and store my oil in a closed bottle to later reuse when frying.</p>
<p>Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the perfect snack for you to munch on while watching a movie or just serve as an apperitive. It is crunchy and has a rich flavour.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chin chin is a delicious treat from <strong>Nigeria</strong>. It has a distinct taste of cinnamon and can be crunchy or slightly soft on the inside. The dough is easy and fun to make and it takes little time. For those of you who do not own a deep fryer, do not fret. You can use a pot with oil, in fact, that is what I do. Let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>420g Flour</li>
<li>100g Sugar</li>
<li>1 Egg</li>
<li>40g Butter</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
<li>1 tsp Cinnamon</li>
<li>160ml Milk</li>
<li>pinch Salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt into a bowl.</li>
<li>Melt the butter, add the egg and melted butter to the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Mix first with a whisk or spatula and then with your fingers until achieving a crumbly texture.</li>
<li>Add in the milk bit by bit to make sure the consistency is correct. Do not add all the milk at once!</li>
<li>When the dough has achieved a good consistency, so you can kneed it by hand, transfer it onto a clean surface and kneed until it is no longer sticky. You will know whether the dough is ready by pressing down on it with a finger and the dough will come back up.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Separate the dough into two and place it on a floured surface.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough until it is about 1/2 cm thick. (The thicker the dough, the softer the inside will be.)</li>
<li>Cut the dough into 1 cm thin strips and then into squares.</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a deep pot. (Use a small piece of dough to test the temperature. When it starts to flout and there are bubbles around it, the oil should be at the right heat.)</li>
<li>Place the chin chin in the oil and keep stirring with a laddle.</li>
<li>When the chin chin have aquired a nice golden brown colour, remove them from the oil and place them on kitchen paper to soak up some of the oil.</li>
<li>Repeat the process with the other half of the dough.</li>
<li>And you&#8217;re done!</li>
</ol>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are tired of fast food but miss donuts, this is the recipe for you. Make your favorite treat in your very own kitchen!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though, these specific doughnuts are from <strong>Nigeria</strong>, donuts actually originated in the Netherlands. As far back as the 19th century, the Dutch have been making &#8220;olykoeks&#8221; or &#8220;oil cakes&#8221;. But even before that, doughnuts might have appeared in Asian cuisine. Even the Greeks and Roman fried dough and coated in sugar. Even the Arab&#8217;s had their variation of dough fritters. It seems all across the globe, people enjoyed (and still do) fried dough pastries. Be it coated in sugar or with chocolate or other toppings. It is no wonder, there is a variant made in Nigeria. Wherever they are from, doughnuts are a delicious snack.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>400g All Purpose 0r Hard Flour</li>
<li>60g Sugar</li>
<li>65g Butter</li>
<li>120ml Evaporated Milk (at room temperature)</li>
<li>2 tsp Dry Yeast</li>
<li>1 tsp Salt</li>
<li>1 Egg Yolk</li>
<li>1 tsp Vanilla aroma</li>
<li>4Tbs Water</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Mix the flour, yeast, salt and sugar.</li>
<li>Use a fork to mix the yolk, the milk and the vanilla extract.</li>
<li>Use your fingers to incorporate the butter into the flour and mix until obtaining a crumbly texture.</li>
<li>Pour in the milk and use a spatula to stir.</li>
<li>When the dough has a thick enough consistency, gradually add water.</li>
<li>Knead the dough until it is smooth.</li>
<li>Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out on a floured surface until it is about 1/2 cm thick. Don&#8217;t make it too thin!</li>
<li>Use a donut cutter or a glass and a bottle cap to cut out your donuts.</li>
<li>Roll the rest of the dough into a ball and leave to rest for another 20 minutes or while you fry the first batch. (Try not to reuse the scraps too many times or your donuts will be rough.)</li>
<li>Heat up some sunflower oil in a pot and fry you dounuts until golden brown.</li>
<li>Place them shortly on some kitchen paper and then sift them in sugar.</li>
<li>Repeat this process with the donut middles.</li>
<li>Cut out the rest of the dough and cut squares and triangles out of the rest. (Check the notes and variations for further ideas)</li>
<li>Sift everything in sugar and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The centers as well as the squares and triangles can also be sifted in sugar or you can coat them in chocolate, honey or syrup. They can be served as their own pastry.</p>
