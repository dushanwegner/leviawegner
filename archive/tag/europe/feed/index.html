The pastry evolved and he now used name, choux pastry was given due to it&#8217;s unusual shape after being baked. &#8216;Choux&#8217; is french for cabbage. The dough used for Profiterole can also be used to make other choux pastries such as eclairs. Don&#8217;t be scared off, try it yourself!</p>

</ol>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dough.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-994 " src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dough-300x295.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="368" /></a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Let it cool for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Add in the eggs one at a time and mix thoroughly until the eggs are well incorporated.</li>
<li>Fill the dough into a piping bag with a round nozzle.</li>

<li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC fan.</li>
<li>Pipe 2cm wide circles onto the paper. Pipe on the same spot without moving the nozzle.</li>
<li>Place the tray in the oven for 15 minutes.</li>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Choux pastry: This pastry looks quite tricky and it is definitely a step up from your average lemon loaf or banana bread. Profiterole are not too hard to make, though. There is not as much that can go wrong. It is actually fun to make.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<ol start="22">
<li>Place the cake in the fridge for several hours or until serving.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Biscuit cake: This is a tricky type of cake. It is easy to get something wrong. In fact, I have had huge trouble with it before. Sometimes it is not completely done in the middle. So make sure to do the toothpick trial exactly in the centre and don&#8217;t take the cake out too soon. If you take it out and put it back in too many times, it will collapse and become dry. Make sure the eggs are correctly beaten so you get the right texture. It should be fluffy on the inside.</p>
<p>Coffee: There is a distinct difference in the taste of instant coffee versus a good blend. This coffee&#8217;s main taste is coffee. So it is important to use a good coffee for the soak. Instant coffee is best for cream or the cake itself but I much prefer using coffee made with a coffee machine rather than instant coffee for the soak. It has a stronger more distinct taste to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Spanakopita recipe is believed to have been born in <strong>Greece</strong> over 400 years ago. It is similar to the Turkish dish ispanakli. It is a typical dish all across Greece. This savoury delight consists of a filo pastry filled with spinach and different soft cheeses. This recipe uses curd and a feta topping. It is also made with creamed Spinach to give it more moisture. Most chefs will personalise the recipe by adding their own flare. Be it herbs or cheeses, the smallest of changes in ingredients can have a huge impact on the final result. However, some people do not like spinach and, making a huge pie can be a bit much. This recipe is meant to be made in a 3 by 4 standard muffin tray. That way, you have 12 little pies.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Filo dough</li>
<li>250g Frozen Creamed Spinach</li>
<li>300g Curd</li>
<li>200g Feta Cheese</li>
<li>50ml Olive Oil</li>
<li>Salt | Pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Defrost the cream spinach.</li>
<li>Put the olive oil in a large pan and cook the creamed spinach for 5-7 minutes or until it is hot.</li>
<li>Mix the spinach with the curd and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 210ºC.</li>
<li>Next, lay out the dough and cut out circles using either a sharp knife or scrissors.</li>
<li>Put the dough in the holes of a muffin tray.</li>
<li>Fill the dough with the spinach-curd mixture.</li>
<li>Cut thin slices of feta cheese and place them on top of the pies.</li>
<li>Bake the pies for 12-15 minutes.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>You can always add more seasoning to the filling. You can also add diced onions or red bell peppers. If there is a specific type of cheese you prefer to feta or want to add, feel free to.</p>

<p>Heading to Italy</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Focaccia is a typical Italian recipe believed to have originated before the Roman Empire was formed. Some historians also hold the believe it originated in Ancient Greece. It is important to acknowledge that unrisen flat bread has also long been made throughout the Middle East. However, it can be confirmed that recipes similar to this one can be found in Turkey, France, Spain and Greece. It is also speculated to be the origin of pizza dough. Despite its rich history, it is an easily approachable recipe. It can be varied by adding toppings before baking or filling the finished bread with cheese or ham.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Destination</h2>
<p>Heading to <em><strong>Germany</strong></em></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Apple Rolls are pretty similar to cinnamon rolls when it comes to the dough but they differ in the filling. There are many ways to give this recipe a personal twist. Apfel-Rosinen-Schnecken are typically eaten in Germany. They are made with yeast dough and apple compot. Yeast dough is quite tricky when getting started but it becomes easier and even fun to make it the more times you do it.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>For the dough</p>
<ul>
<li>500g Flour</li>
<li>250ml Milk</li>
<li>75g Butter</li>
<li>25g fresh Yeast</li>
<li>70g Sugar</li>
<li>1 package Vanilla Sugar</li>
<li>pinch of Salt</li>
</ul>
<p>For the filling</p>
<ul>
<li>500g of Apples (5 small apples)</li>
<li>100g of Brown Sugar</li>
<li>optional: Cinnamon, Raisins, Plums</li>
</ul>
<p>For the topping</p>
<ul>
<li>64g Powdered Sugar</li>
<li>1Tbsp Milk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>1- Cut the apples and place them on a baking tray covering them with the sugar, leaving them to soak.</p>
<p>2- Warm the milk and place the butter inside. When melted, add sugar, vanilla sugar and a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>3- Remove the mixture from the heat and crumble the fresh yeast, adding it to the mixture and stirring thoroughly.</p>
<p>4- Add the milk-yeast mixture to the flour and knead it until obtaining a homogenous dough.</p>
<p>5- Cover the dough and let it rise for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>6- Cover a large area with flour and roll out the dough forming a rectangle.</p>
<p>7- Blend the apples until obtaining a consisten compot.</p>
<p>8- Spread the compot on the dough.</p>
<p>9- Roll up the dough and cut it into 4cm thick rolls.</p>
<p>10- Place the rolls on the baking tray with the cut side up.</p>
<p>11- Cover the tray and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes.</p>
<p>12- Heat the oven to 250ºC and bake the apple rolls for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>11- Mix the powdered sugar with the milk and spread it over the apple rolls.</p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Cinnamon- Looking to spice the apple compot with cinnamon? No problem. Sprinkle some cinnamon on the apples before leaving them to soak.</p>
<p>Raisins &#8211; Raisins and Apples go hand in hand in many recipes. I haven&#8217;t included them in the recipe itself but you can add them into the apple compot before spreading it on the dough.</p>
<p>Plums &#8211; If you want to add a plum centre, align plums on the side from which you will roll up the dough. That way, your apple rolls will have a nice plum centre.</p>
