					<description><![CDATA[Autumn, harvest, fall. Whatever you call it, it means apples, cinnamon, carrots and other distinct flavours. What better way to celebrate this season than a carrot cake?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrot cake as we know it today is believed to be from <strong>Persia</strong>, however using carrots in a cake was no unusual practice. Around the 15th century, sugar was scarce and expensive. Not many people could afford to buy and much less use large amounts of sugar. That is when carrots came in. The roots have a sweetness to them that could replace the sugar in the cake. Of course, nowadays we don&#8217;t have to rely on the sweetness of the root, but it still adds a nice flavour to the cake.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Cake base:</p>
<ul>
<li>400g Carrots</li>
<li>85g Crunchy Almonds</li>
<li>100g Flaked Almonds</li>
<li>200g Flour</li>
<li>1tsp Baking Powder</li>
<li>1 pinch Salt</li>
<li>4 Eggs</li>
<li>250g Sugar</li>
<li>100ml Sunflower Oil</li>
<li>5Tbsp Orange Juice</li>
<li>Butter for greasing</li>
</ul>
<p>Topping and decoration:</p>
<ul>
<li>200g Powdered Sugar</li>
<li>5 Tbsp Orange Juice</li>
<li>60g Fondant</li>
<li>Yellow, Red and Blue Food colouring</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wash the carrots, cut their ends and grate them.</li>
<li>Add the almonds to the carrots.</li>
<li>Mix the baking powder and salt into the flour.</li>
<li>Pour the flour into the carrot almond mixture and stir well until the carrots are well coated.</li>
<li>Set the mixture aside and preheat the oven to 160ºC.</li>
<li>Separate the egg yolk from the whites.</li>
<li>Mix the oil, juice and sugar into the egg yolks.</li>
<li>Beat the egg whites until stiff.</li>
<li>Add the egg yolk mixture to the carrots stir well.</li>
<li>Fold in the egg whites.</li>
<li>Pour the batter into a greased cake pan.</li>
<li>Bake the cake for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
</ol>
<p>Decoration and Topping</p>
<ol>
<li>While the cake is in the oven, prepare the decoration.</li>
<li>Separate 40g of fondant from the 60g and add yellow and red until obtaining the desired orange colour.</li>
<li>Add blue and yellow to the remaining 20g. Mix well until the fondant is the correct green colour.</li>
<li>Roll out the fondant. Fold the orange one in half.</li>
<li>Cut six pieces off the orange fondant.</li>
<li>Roll out the green fondant and cut thin strips from it.</li>
<li>Cut triangles into the green fondant and roll it up.</li>
<li>Shape the orange fondant into little carrots and cut thin lines into them.</li>
<li>Wet the base of the leaves and the top of the carrots and put them together. (notes)</li>
<li>Take the cake out of the oven and let it cool.</li>
<li>Mix the juice into the powdered sugar until well integrated.</li>
<li>Let the mixture thicken for a bit before pouring it over the cake.</li>
<li>Place the six carrots on the cake distributed evenly.</li>
<li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Fondant: If the fondant gets too sticky when shaping it, wet it with a bit of water and sprinkle some powdered sugar.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sufganiyot or Sufganiyah (plural) are a delicious dessert that will have everyone's mouth watering. I can assure you, these will fill every little kid's "dessert stomach". Because we all know how much children pride themselves on always having space for sweets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These jelly doughnuts are typical in <strong>Israel</strong>, however similar ones can be found across cultures. The german <em>Berliner</em> or the Spanish and Latin American <em>Buñuelos</em>. The Israeli version is actually derived from the german Berliner which used to be filled with meat rather than jams and jellies. It is only later that these yeast dough doughnuts were filled with jelly and covered with icing sugar. They taste absolutely amazing I can assure you. But, don&#8217;t take my word for it. Try it yourself!</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>50g Sugar</li>
<li>350g Flour</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
<li>25g Butter</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Nutmeg</li>
<li>2 tsp Salt</li>
<li>1 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>180ml Water</li>
<li>Oil for frying</li>
<li>A glass of strawberry or raspberry jam</li>
<li>60g Icing Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Heat the water until it is lukewarm.</li>
<li>Mix one teaspoon of the sugar into the water before crumbling the yeast into the water.</li>
<li>Set the yeast aside for 5 to 10 minutes to proof it. (notes)</li>
<li>Sift the sugar, flour, nutmeg and salt into a bowl.</li>
<li>Rub the butter into the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the dry ingredients and pour in the yeast mixture.</li>
<li>Use a fork to mix everything together until the consistency is sticky enough to knead by hand.</li>
<li>When the dough is smooth, continue kneading it on a floured surface.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for half and hour or until it is double its size.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out and use a round cookie cutter to cut out the doughnuts.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mix and roll the dough out too many times or it will get tough.</li>
<li>Leave the doughnuts to rise for another 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat the oil.</li>
<li>Fry the doughnuts from both sides until they are golden-brown.</li>
<li>Fill the jam into a piping bag with, preferably, a long nozzle.</li>
<li>Use the piping bag to fill the sufganiyah with whatever jam you like best.</li>
<li>Sift the icing sugar over the sufagniyah and they are ready to serve and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Deep Frying: You do not need any special equipment for deep drying. It is possible to just use a large pot filled with enough oil so the pastry is floating. You will be needing a ladle to pick the pastry out of the pot. The oil can be filtered after letting it cooled down. I usually use a coffee filter and store my oil in a closed bottle to later reuse when frying.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you want to put a special twist on the known hot dogs? Use this recipe to create something exceptional but still familiar.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who would have thought that hot dogs could possibly be from <strong>China</strong>? Well they originally aren&#8217;t. The commonly known hot dogs first appeared in the USA but the sausages themselves came from Europe. Specifically, they were brought by German immigrants. The name hot dog refers to the &#8216;dachshund&#8217;. The sausage dog. It was first used in Germany as a name for the sausages and was later translated and used to refer to the snack. This recipe, however, will help you make a slightly different and, in my opinion, better version of the hot dog. Instead of sticking a hot sausage between two buns, the sausage is wrapped in yeast dough and covered with sesame before being baked. Super easy to prepare these hand-sized snack rolls make the perfect food to be the star at any picnic or to make school children extra happy with their lunch box.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>10 Wieners</li>
<li>1 small beaten Egg</li>
<li>Sesame Seeds</li>
</ul>
<p>For the dough</p>
<ul>
<li>400g Flour</li>
<li>220ml Water</li>
<li>3Tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>2/3 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>1tsp Salt</li>
<li>3Tbsp Melted Butter</li>
<li>1 small Egg</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Warm the water and mix in the Sugar until disolved.</li>
<li>Crumble in the yeast and integrate it well</li>
<li>Leave the mixture to proof for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix the salt into the flour and form a well in the middle.</li>
<li>Pour in the yeast mixture, the butter, the egg and a bit of the water.</li>
<li>Mix with a fork. Add in the rest of the water.</li>
<li>Use your hands to keep mixing the dough.</li>
<li>Tilt the dough onto a floured surface and keep kneeding until the dough is smooth.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for an hour or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Separate the dough into 10 pieces and roll them out into strips 3 times as long as the sausages.</li>
<li>Wrap the sausages in the dough and leave them to rest for another 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC.</li>
<li>Brush the eggwash over the hot dog buns and sprinkle with sesame.</li>
<li>Bake for 10-15 minutes until they are golden on top.</li>
<li>Take out of the oven and serve hot.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are looking for a fresh and delicious desert that combines Matcha and the well known cheesecake, look no further. This is the recipe for you. And you don't even need to heat up your oven!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn&#8217;t think of <strong>Japan</strong> when the typical matcha tea is mentioned? Matcha is a typical Japanese green tea powder. It has a rather bitter flavour and a characteristic green colour. In this recipe, cheesecake, matcha and cookie base are combined to create an amazing culinary exploration. This is a great desert that is not too sweet but full of flavour. It also does not require the use of an oven and is served cold making it a deliciously fresh treat. The thousand and one ways to decorate it make it a real showstopper. If you want to add not only flavour, but also a beautiful hero to your meal, this is the recipe for you.</p>
