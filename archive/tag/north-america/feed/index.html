					<description><![CDATA[Looking for new ideas to try for breakfast? This is a delicious treat that will be loved by all. With infinite filling options, this is a recipe for everyone.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dutch Baby Pancakes originated in the <strong>USA</strong>, Seattle to be precise. They are derived from the german &#8220;pfannkuchen&#8221;. The batter is almost identical, but the method of preparation is different. Funny how changing only a few steps in the recipe can change the outcome so drastically. You can fill the pancake with anything you desire. Be it yogurt, fruits, pudding or just powdered sugar. So, whether it is a dessert or a breakfast dish, this is the recipe for you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[An amazing treat to finalise your dinner? The perfect breakfast pastry? Well, this is the recipe for you. But don't take my name for it, try it yourself!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the many rumours revolving around this pastry from the <strong>USA</strong>, there is one tale that is most widely accepted. Allegedly, a baker in Boston got mad and tossed a batch of unfinished rolls in the oven. You can imagine everyone&#8217;s surprise when the result was so absolutely delicious. Of course, dinner rolls can be enjoyed at any time of the day. Be it a roll with jam and butter for breakfast or a honey-topped roll for dinner.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>240ml Soy Milk</li>
<li>1 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>60g Ghee</li>
<li>400g Wholegrain Flour</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Topping</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Tbsp Ghee</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Honey</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Warm the soy milk and mix in the sugar.</li>
<li>Take the soy milk off the stove and crumble in the yeast. (notes)</li>
<li>Let the yeast proof for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Rub the Ghee into the flour until obtaining a crumbly texture.</li>
<li>Crack one of the eggs into the flour and add in the yeast mixture.</li>
<li>Use a fork to stir until a dough starts to form.</li>
<li>Start kneading with your hands.</li>
<li>Tilt the dough onto a clean surface and keep kneading.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Punch the dough down and divide it into about 14-16 pieces.</li>
<li>Place the rolls into a square glass tray and let them rise for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC.</li>
<li>Beat the egg with a fork before using a pastry brush to apply the egg-wash to the pastry.</li>
<li>Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden on top.</li>
<li>Melt the butter and mix in the honey.</li>
<li>Separate the rolls from each other.</li>
<li>Brush with honey topping and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are looking for a sweet snack, I've got you. This recipe makes absolutely delicious Malasadas. A type of Hawaiian donuts. Go ahead! Try it!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Picture the beautiful flowing hills and mountains of <strong>Hawaii</strong>. The beautiful beaches. But what of the culture? Nowadays, our knowledge of the Hawaiian culture is twisted by common misconceptions. For example, people born or living on the islands are not automatically Hawaiians. Hawaiians can trace their roots to the original inhabitants of the islands. Another common misunderstanding is that &#8216;Aloha&#8217; is equivalent to &#8216;Hello&#8217;. This is not in fact true as Aloha is more a way of life in general than a greeting and translates as &#8216;joyfully sharing life&#8217;. The frequently celebrated Luau&#8217;s are not in fact for the Hawaiians. They are not regularly celebrated by the residents.</p>
<p>When it comes to Hawaiian food, much of it is derived from recipes brought there by immigrants. Malasadas are believed to have first originated in Sao Miguel, an island in the Azores. They were later introduced in Hawaii and are now seen as a Hawaiian speciality. They are a common treat and can be found in most bakeries there. The name Malasadas means &#8220;poorly cooked&#8221;, which refers to the texture and crispy exterior of the pastry. It can be eaten with a custard filling or with ice cream, coated in sugar or not coated. It is easily adaptable to every person&#8217;s taste.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>500g Flour</li>
<li>1 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>30ml Water</li>
<li>50g Sugar + 100g for coating</li>
<li>1tsp Salt</li>
<li>4 Eggs</li>
<li>60g Butter</li>
<li>Oil for frying</li>
<li>500ml Milk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Warm the water and mix in a teaspoon of sugar, then crumble ibn the yeast.</li>
<li>Leave the mixture to proof for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix the flour, sugar and salt.</li>
<li>Rub the butter into the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Heat the milk and beat the eggs.</li>
<li>Mix the milk, eggs and the yeast mixture into the flour.</li>
<li>Use a fork to mix the dough until it has the right consistency to kneed by hand.</li>
<li>Kneed the dough before transferring it onto a clean surface.</li>
<li>Keep kneeding until you obtain a smooth dough.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rest for 30 minutes or until it is double in size.</li>
<li>Form the dough into balls before flattening it a bit and poking a hole in the middle.<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-919 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/C54A3BE6-7AAD-414C-806E-A67AEEE87A3C_1_105_c-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/C54A3BE6-7AAD-414C-806E-A67AEEE87A3C_1_105_c-225x300.jpeg 225w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/C54A3BE6-7AAD-414C-806E-A67AEEE87A3C_1_105_c.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></li>

<li>Heat the oil to 180ºC.</li>
<li>Fry the Malasadas until golden brown.</li>
<li>Remove them from the oil using a laddle.</li>
<li>Fill the sugar for coating in a ziplock bag and put the freshly fried Malasadas in.</li>
<li>Coat them sugar until fully covered before removing them from the bag and putting aside.</li>
<li>Repeat this process until all malasadas are covered in sugar.</li>
<li>Half them and eat with your favorite icecream or just like that.</li>

I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Deep Frying: You do not need any special equipment for deep drying. It is possible to just use a large pot filled with enough oil so the pastry is floating. You will be needing a ladle to pick the pastry out of the pot. The oil can be filtered after letting it cooled down. I usually use a coffee filter and store my oil in a closed bottle to later reuse when frying.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!!
