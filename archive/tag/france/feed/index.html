										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This well known pastry was first made by a chef of Catherine Medici of Florence who was Italian but moved to <strong>France</strong> in the year 1540.

The pastry evolved and he now used name, choux pastry was given due to it&#8217;s unusual shape after being baked. &#8216;Choux&#8217; is french for cabbage. The dough used for Profiterole can also be used to make other choux pastries such as eclairs. Don&#8217;t be scared off, try it yourself!</p>

<p class="p1">Choux pastry: This pastry looks quite tricky and it is definitely a step up from your average lemon loaf or banana bread. Profiterole are not too hard to make, though. There is not as much that can go wrong. It is actually fun to make.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking for ideas for breakfast? Look no further. This simple and delicious Crepe recipe will have the entire family happy and well-fed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know, Crepes were not originally only a breakfast food in <strong>France</strong>? In fact, they were used like bread. In french folklore, the origin is set in the 13th century. It is remembered as a happy accident. A housewife spilling porridge onto a cooking stone. Other sources claim that crepes first appeared in the year 472 when they were offered to pilgrims visiting Rome. No matter where they first appeared, one thing is certain, and that is that here they are. And they are probably here to stay. It is a loved breakfast or even dessert and it is quite simple to make.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul class="ingredientes">
<li>125g Flour</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
<li>250ml Milk</li>
<li>50g Butter</li>
<li>5g Sugar</li>
<li>1 pinch Salt</li>
<li>1Tbsp Butter for the pan</li>
</ul>
<p>Whipped Cream (alternatively, use store-bought whipped cream)</p>
<ul>
<li>250g Heavy Cream</li>
<li>20g Powdered Sugar (more or less depending on preference)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sift the flour, sugar and salt together into a small bowl.</li>
<li>Melt the butter over medium heat, adding in the milk once the butter is melted.</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the milk mixture and use an electric mixer to mix the ingredients.</li>
<li>Spoon the flour into the milk bit by bit mixing well to avoid clumps.</li>
<li>Keep mixing until the batter is smooth.</li>
<li>Melt the tablespoon of butter in a large pan.</li>
<li>Pour two solid spoons full or one deep soup ladle full of batter onto the pan.</li>
<li>Leave to cook through until the upper side is solid, before flipping the crepe.</li>
<li>Put the crepe onto a plate while preparing the whipped cream.</li>
<li>Beat the heavy cream on low speed until it is thick before adding in the powdered sugar gradually.</li>
<li>The whipped cream should form stiff peaks when you take out the mixer.</li>
<li>Fill the cream into a piping bag. You can use a star attachment to give the cream form.</li>
<li>Fill the crepes with cream and sprinkle with a bit of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>Et voilà!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Filling: Crepes, like other pancakes, can be enjoyed with an assortment of fillings and toppings. Some more usual than other. Common crepe topping are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lemon and sugar</li>
<li>Jam</li>
<li>Nutella</li>
<li>Fruit</li>
<li>Whipped cream</li>
</ul>
<p>And, my personal favorite:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Whatever you choose to put on them, crepes are delicious idea for every breakfast or brunch.</p>
