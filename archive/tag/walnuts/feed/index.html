					<description><![CDATA[Everyone knows brownies, but there are several things about them you might not know. Check out this post for further insights on this treat and the recipe for it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brownies are always linked to the <strong>USA</strong>. The treat is known for its rich chocolate flavour and crispy outside with a soft interior texture. Despite how popular they are, many people wonder where the brownie first came from. So much so, that people have put together <a href="http://www.newenglandrecipes.org/html/brownies.html">compilations of mentions of brownies</a>. Brownies are said to have first appeared in the early 20th century, more specifically, in of Fannie Farmer&#8217;s cookbook in 1896. The original brownies were very different from what we perceive as brownies today. They did, in fact, not contain any chocolate and were flavoured with molasses. The chocolate first found its way into the mix in 1898 when the Kansas City Journal mentioned them. From there on, chocolate brownies started appearing all over in advertisements and bakeries. The first mention of chocolate brownies in a cookbook was in 1899 in the Machias Cook Book. The there featured recipe is much more similar to the one we use today.</p>
