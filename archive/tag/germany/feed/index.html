										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many typically german breakfasts but in <strong>Germany</strong>, there is also a variant of the well known pancakes. Pancakes in general reach as far back as the Stone Age. It has appeared often in literature and everyone can visualise a pancake. However, over time, each region or country went adapting the familiar recipe and presenting it in different ways. The following recipe is the German version of this very nutritious food. It is a very easy recipe and, who doesn&#8217;t enjoy a nice Pfannkuchen for breakfast?</p>

<li>1 1/2 Tbsp Chocolate Chips</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you feeling like travelling to Germany without leaving your own kitchen? These delicious apple rolls are exactly what you need. Spiced with a bit of cinnamon or filled with plums or raisins, they can easily be adapted to fit everyones likes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Destination</h2>
<p>Heading to <em><strong>Germany</strong></em></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Apple Rolls are pretty similar to cinnamon rolls when it comes to the dough but they differ in the filling. There are many ways to give this recipe a personal twist. Apfel-Rosinen-Schnecken are typically eaten in Germany. They are made with yeast dough and apple compot. Yeast dough is quite tricky when getting started but it becomes easier and even fun to make it the more times you do it.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>For the dough</p>
<ul>
<li>500g Flour</li>
<li>250ml Milk</li>
<li>75g Butter</li>
<li>25g fresh Yeast</li>
<li>70g Sugar</li>
<li>1 package Vanilla Sugar</li>
<li>pinch of Salt</li>
</ul>
<p>For the filling</p>
<ul>
<li>500g of Apples (5 small apples)</li>
<li>100g of Brown Sugar</li>
<li>optional: Cinnamon, Raisins, Plums</li>
</ul>
<p>For the topping</p>
<ul>
<li>64g Powdered Sugar</li>
<li>1Tbsp Milk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>1- Cut the apples and place them on a baking tray covering them with the sugar, leaving them to soak.</p>
<p>2- Warm the milk and place the butter inside. When melted, add sugar, vanilla sugar and a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>3- Remove the mixture from the heat and crumble the fresh yeast, adding it to the mixture and stirring thoroughly.</p>
<p>4- Add the milk-yeast mixture to the flour and knead it until obtaining a homogenous dough.</p>
<p>5- Cover the dough and let it rise for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>6- Cover a large area with flour and roll out the dough forming a rectangle.</p>
<p>7- Blend the apples until obtaining a consisten compot.</p>
<p>8- Spread the compot on the dough.</p>
<p>9- Roll up the dough and cut it into 4cm thick rolls.</p>
<p>10- Place the rolls on the baking tray with the cut side up.</p>
<p>11- Cover the tray and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes.</p>
<p>12- Heat the oven to 250ÂºC and bake the apple rolls for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>11- Mix the powdered sugar with the milk and spread it over the apple rolls.</p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Cinnamon- Looking to spice the apple compot with cinnamon? No problem. Sprinkle some cinnamon on the apples before leaving them to soak.</p>
<p>Raisins &#8211; Raisins and Apples go hand in hand in many recipes. I haven&#8217;t included them in the recipe itself but you can add them into the apple compot before spreading it on the dough.</p>
<p>Plums &#8211; If you want to add a plum centre, align plums on the side from which you will roll up the dough. That way, your apple rolls will have a nice plum centre.</p>
