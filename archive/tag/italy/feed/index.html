										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Cake is believed to first have been made in Germany, however, this one is made with a mascarpone cream, making it attributable to <strong>Italy</strong>. Coffee cake wasn&#8217;t really invented, it was derived from other cakes. Mascarpone is originally from Italy and even got nominated the P.A.T. (Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale or &#8220;traditional regional food product&#8221;) by the Italian government. This cake is made with a soft biscuit cake base and coffee flavoured mascarpone cream. It tastes similar to Tiramisu but is slightly heavier. It can be enjoyed whenever though it is best served cold so the cream doesn&#8217;t melt.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Biscuit cake: This is a tricky type of cake. It is easy to get something wrong. In fact, I have had huge trouble with it before. Sometimes it is not completely done in the middle. So make sure to do the toothpick trial exactly in the centre and don&#8217;t take the cake out too soon. If you take it out and put it back in too many times, it will collapse and become dry. Make sure the eggs are correctly beaten so you get the right texture. It should be fluffy on the inside.</p>
<p>Coffee: There is a distinct difference in the taste of instant coffee versus a good blend. This coffee&#8217;s main taste is coffee. So it is important to use a good coffee for the soak. Instant coffee is best for cream or the cake itself but I much prefer using coffee made with a coffee machine rather than instant coffee for the soak. It has a stronger more distinct taste to it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Feel like eating something Italian but not in the mood for a huge, cheese-covered pizza? This recipe is simple and easy to follow and you will have the steaming bread on your plate in a jiffy!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Destination</h2>
<p>Heading to Italy</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Focaccia is a typical Italian recipe believed to have originated before the Roman Empire was formed. Some historians also hold the believe it originated in Ancient Greece. It is important to acknowledge that unrisen flat bread has also long been made throughout the Middle East. However, it can be confirmed that recipes similar to this one can be found in Turkey, France, Spain and Greece. It is also speculated to be the origin of pizza dough. Despite its rich history, it is an easily approachable recipe. It can be varied by adding toppings before baking or filling the finished bread with cheese or ham.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">500g Flour</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">300ml Water</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">60ml Olive Oil (extra for greasing the pan and for the top)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2tsp Sugar</span></li>
<li>2tsp Salt</li>
<li>1package(25g) Fresh Yeast</li>
<li>Sea Salt and Rosemary</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a metal bowl, warm the water until lukewarm and add the sugar. Take the water off the heat. Crumble the yeast into the water and mix well. Let the mixture set for 5-10 minutes to proof the yeast.</li>
<li>Put the flour in a large mixing bowl and add the salt on one side. Pour the yeast mixture on the other side. Try to make sure that yeast and salt don&#8217;t touch directly until it is totally unavoidable! Salt turns yeast off. Add the oil.</li>
<li>Use a fork to mix the mixture until you can knead it by hand. Knead until obtaining a smooth dough.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with a tea towel and let it to rise for 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
<li>When the dough has risen, oil a baking pan and tilt the dough into it. Spread the dough until it is about 2cm thick.</li>
<li>Make deep holes in the dough and fill them with a bit of rosemary. Sprinkle the focaccia with salt and cover it with a tea towel. Leave to rise for another 20 minutes.</li>
<li>When the dough has finished rising, sprinkle a bit of oil over it.</li>
<li>Bake the focaccia on 200ºC for 20 minutes or until golden.</li>
<li>Cut and serve warm with a bit of olive oil and salt.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Focaccia, being bread, can be eaten in a thousand and one ways. With ham and cheese filling or with tomatoes and olives intead of rosemary and salt on top. Anything you like can be added to it. It has a lot of room for your creativity and prefferences.</p>
<p>You can also vary the choice of flour. For example, you can use 250g of spelt flour and 250g of plain flour. That combination is nice with a cheese and onion topping or cherry tomatoes and black olives.</p>
