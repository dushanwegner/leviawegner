					<description><![CDATA[If you prefer savoury, this recipe is definitely a must try. The crispy filo pastry combined with the creamy filling and the salty feta cheese topping is a perfect orchestra of tastes. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Spanakopita recipe is believed to have been born in <strong>Greece</strong> over 400 years ago. It is similar to the Turkish dish ispanakli. It is a typical dish all across Greece. This savoury delight consists of a filo pastry filled with spinach and different soft cheeses. This recipe uses curd and a feta topping. It is also made with creamed Spinach to give it more moisture. Most chefs will personalise the recipe by adding their own flare. Be it herbs or cheeses, the smallest of changes in ingredients can have a huge impact on the final result. However, some people do not like spinach and, making a huge pie can be a bit much. This recipe is meant to be made in a 3 by 4 standard muffin tray. That way, you have 12 little pies.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Filo dough</li>
<li>250g Frozen Creamed Spinach</li>

<li>Next, lay out the dough and cut out circles using either a sharp knife or scrissors.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[This delicious savoury cake will be perfect to accompany your picnic. Or maybe you can serve a slice for breakfast? Whatever the occasion, this is a truly marvellous snack.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend brought over fresh figs, just as if she had picked it from a tree on the mountainside facing the Mediterranean sea in <strong>Greece</strong>. I didn&#8217;t have to think long about what to do with them, because this recipe had been sitting in the back of my mind for a while. The crispy salty bacon and the texture of the figs form the perfect harmony. One can only imagine how this treat was enjoyed by the philosophers of old. Add a spoonful of greek yoghurt to serve and enjoy!</p>
<p>Figs are commonly known to be of greek origin, however, figs first originated in Asia and only spread through Europe with the Greeks and Romans. Fig trees can live up to 100 years and grow up to fifty feet, although most only grow 10 to 30 feet. Bacon, on the other hand, was used during the 16th century by the English to refer to all pork. The salted pork however, appeared much earlier in China. Both these star ingredients in the following recipe have an old and elaborate history. This recipe is called a cake, not because it is sweet, but because the texture and the batter are that of a cake. It results in an extremely delicious creation. But, don&#8217;t take my word for it, try it yourself!</p>
