					<description><![CDATA[I give you the first in The Caramel Saga. A tale of triumphs and failures, testing and learning.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caramel is a tricky treat that requires lots of precision and attention. Below, I recorded my process and notes on what to improve on next time.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>200g sugar (100%)</li>
<li>optional nuts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In my case, I cut out little leaf shapes.</li>
<li>Heat the sugar in a pot at medium heat. It should reach a temperature between 160-177C.</li>
<li>It took 10 minutes for the sugar to start melting.</li>
<li>7 minutes later, the sugar completely melted and caramelized, ready to be poured out.</li>
<li>Using a pastry brush, I spread some of the caramel on the leaf shapes.</li>
<li>After the caramel has hardened, letting it drop onto the table made it break into pieces.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>First, make sure to spread caramel to get a thin surface. The small shards look like amber pieces and would look great as decoration.<br />
I should test dusting the caramel with starch or powdered sugar to reduce stickiness.<br />
Though a simple recipe and process, this one is a success.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>I did try dusting the caramel with powdered sugar and it did help. Since I used caster sugar, the leaves had a pretty border, as can be seen in the image.</p>
<h3>Watch out! Sharp edges!</h3>

					<description><![CDATA[These savoury pumpkin buns are the perfect side for any fall meal! They’re rich in flavour and airy, best served with some butter or cream cheese.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fall has arrived and everyone knows what that means! It is the season of rainy days, Halloween and pumpkin spice. While in some countries getting at the typical orange pumpkins may be hard, this recipe works perfectly well with butternut squash and other roasted gourds. I, for one, used butternut squash and Neapolitan squash. Often, pumpkin is accompanied by the signature blend of spices classified as &#8220;pumpkin spice&#8221;. While many such recipes are sweet, these particular buns are actually rather savoury. The seasonings added to the roasted pumpkin give the buns a light saltiness and combine well with the spices to create a deep and rich flavour.</p>
<p>Here is the recipe. Bake and enjoy!</p>
<p>## Recipe</p>
<p>### **Tools**</p>
<p>This recipe requires kitchen twine (unbleached cotton) to shape the buns.</p>
<p>A pastry brush will be helpful for applying the egg-wash.</p>
<p>### Ingredients</p>
<p>For the roasted pumpkin:</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 small pumpkin</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1-2 Tbsp Olive oil</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
Salt</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
Honey</p>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
360 g all-purpose flour</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
2 tsp instant yeast</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
50 g sugar</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 tsp cinnamon</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1/4 tsp nutmeg</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1/4 tsp ground ginger</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
120 ml warm milk</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
60 g melted butter</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 large egg (plus one extra for egg wash)</p>
<p>### Instructions</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Slice the pumpkin into even wedges and lay out on a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil and season.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Roast the pumpkin in the oven for 35-40 minutes or until soft enough to scrape the flesh from the skin.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Purée the pumpkin using a blender and set aside 120g of the resulting purée for the dough.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Preheat the oven to 190C.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Combine the flour, sugar, instant yeast and spices.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Mix the milk, butter, egg and purée until combined. Make sure the butter is not hot.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, mixing well to combine. This dough will require some kneading and you may have to add some more flour.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Cover and let the dough rise for 1 hour or until doubled.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Shape the buns using kitchen twine by carefully wrapping it around. You can also make simple round buns.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Bake at 190C for 15-18min.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Tap the bottom to know if they’re done. If they sound hollow, they are ready!</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Serve and enjoy!!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Autumn, harvest, fall. Whatever you call it, it means apples, cinnamon, carrots and other distinct flavours. What better way to celebrate this season than a carrot cake?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrot cake as we know it today is believed to be from <strong>Persia</strong>, however using carrots in a cake was no unusual practice. Around the 15th century, sugar was scarce and expensive. Not many people could afford to buy and much less use large amounts of sugar. That is when carrots came in. The roots have a sweetness to them that could replace the sugar in the cake. Of course, nowadays we don&#8217;t have to rely on the sweetness of the root, but it still adds a nice flavour to the cake.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Cake base:</p>
<ul>
<li>400g Carrots</li>
<li>85g Crunchy Almonds</li>
<li>100g Flaked Almonds</li>

<p>Topping and decoration:</p>
<ul>
<li>200g Powdered Sugar</li>
<li>5 Tbsp Orange Juice</li>

</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wash the carrots, cut their ends and grate them.</li>
<li>Add the almonds to the carrots.</li>
<li>Mix the baking powder and salt into the flour.</li>
<li>Pour the flour into the carrot almond mixture and stir well until the carrots are well coated.</li>
<li>Set the mixture aside and preheat the oven to 160ºC.</li>
<li>Separate the egg yolk from the whites.</li>
<li>Mix the oil, juice and sugar into the egg yolks.</li>
<li>Beat the egg whites until stiff.</li>
<li>Add the egg yolk mixture to the carrots stir well.</li>
<li>Fold in the egg whites.</li>
<li>Pour the batter into a greased cake pan.</li>
<li>Bake the cake for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
</ol>
<p>Decoration and Topping</p>
<ol>
<li>While the cake is in the oven, prepare the decoration.</li>
<li>Separate 40g of fondant from the 60g and add yellow and red until obtaining the desired orange colour.</li>
<li>Add blue and yellow to the remaining 20g. Mix well until the fondant is the correct green colour.</li>
<li>Roll out the fondant. Fold the orange one in half.</li>
<li>Cut six pieces off the orange fondant.</li>
<li>Roll out the green fondant and cut thin strips from it.</li>
<li>Cut triangles into the green fondant and roll it up.</li>
<li>Shape the orange fondant into little carrots and cut thin lines into them.</li>
<li>Wet the base of the leaves and the top of the carrots and put them together. (notes)</li>
<li>Take the cake out of the oven and let it cool.</li>
<li>Mix the juice into the powdered sugar until well integrated.</li>
<li>Let the mixture thicken for a bit before pouring it over the cake.</li>
<li>Place the six carrots on the cake distributed evenly.</li>
<li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Fondant: If the fondant gets too sticky when shaping it, wet it with a bit of water and sprinkle some powdered sugar.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[An amazing treat to finalise your dinner? The perfect breakfast pastry? Well, this is the recipe for you. But don't take my name for it, try it yourself!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the many rumours revolving around this pastry from the <strong>USA</strong>, there is one tale that is most widely accepted. Allegedly, a baker in Boston got mad and tossed a batch of unfinished rolls in the oven. You can imagine everyone&#8217;s surprise when the result was so absolutely delicious. Of course, dinner rolls can be enjoyed at any time of the day. Be it a roll with jam and butter for breakfast or a honey-topped roll for dinner.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>240ml Soy Milk</li>
<li>1 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>60g Ghee</li>
<li>400g Wholegrain Flour</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Topping</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Tbsp Ghee</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Honey</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Warm the soy milk and mix in the sugar.</li>
<li>Take the soy milk off the stove and crumble in the yeast. (notes)</li>
<li>Let the yeast proof for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Rub the Ghee into the flour until obtaining a crumbly texture.</li>
<li>Crack one of the eggs into the flour and add in the yeast mixture.</li>
<li>Use a fork to stir until a dough starts to form.</li>
<li>Start kneading with your hands.</li>
<li>Tilt the dough onto a clean surface and keep kneading.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Punch the dough down and divide it into about 14-16 pieces.</li>
<li>Place the rolls into a square glass tray and let them rise for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC.</li>
<li>Beat the egg with a fork before using a pastry brush to apply the egg-wash to the pastry.</li>
<li>Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden on top.</li>
<li>Melt the butter and mix in the honey.</li>
<li>Separate the rolls from each other.</li>
<li>Brush with honey topping and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cheesecake is originally of greek origin, however this particular cheesecake is based on Italian cream cheese as well as yogurt. This cheesecake can probably be traced to the <strong>USA</strong> because of its dense and heavy texture. Usually, you can distinguish cheesecake by the taste. German cheesecake is usually made with quark cheese and not too sweet, rather sour, while American cheesecake is much sweeter and creamier. Japanese cheesecakes mostly don&#8217;t even have a base.

<li>Leave the shells to cool while you prepare your filling.</li>
<li>Once the shells are cool, fill them with whatever filling you choose.</li>
<li>Melt the chocolate on low heat in a water-bath.</li>
<li>Mix the heavy cream into the chocolate.</li>
<li>Pour the sauce over the profiteroles.</li>
<li>If you want, you can dip them in chocolate instead. You can then dip them in chia seeds like in the picture below.</li>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Choux pastry: This pastry looks quite tricky and it is definitely a step up from your average lemon loaf or banana bread. Profiterole are not too hard to make, though. There is not as much that can go wrong. It is actually fun to make.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sufganiyot or Sufganiyah (plural) are a delicious dessert that will have everyone's mouth watering. I can assure you, these will fill every little kid's "dessert stomach". Because we all know how much children pride themselves on always having space for sweets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These jelly doughnuts are typical in <strong>Israel</strong>, however similar ones can be found across cultures. The german <em>Berliner</em> or the Spanish and Latin American <em>Buñuelos</em>. The Israeli version is actually derived from the german Berliner which used to be filled with meat rather than jams and jellies. It is only later that these yeast dough doughnuts were filled with jelly and covered with icing sugar. They taste absolutely amazing I can assure you. But, don&#8217;t take my word for it. Try it yourself!</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>50g Sugar</li>
<li>350g Flour</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
<li>25g Butter</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Nutmeg</li>
<li>2 tsp Salt</li>
<li>1 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>180ml Water</li>
<li>Oil for frying</li>
<li>A glass of strawberry or raspberry jam</li>
<li>60g Icing Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Heat the water until it is lukewarm.</li>
<li>Mix one teaspoon of the sugar into the water before crumbling the yeast into the water.</li>
<li>Set the yeast aside for 5 to 10 minutes to proof it. (notes)</li>
<li>Sift the sugar, flour, nutmeg and salt into a bowl.</li>
<li>Rub the butter into the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the dry ingredients and pour in the yeast mixture.</li>
<li>Use a fork to mix everything together until the consistency is sticky enough to knead by hand.</li>
<li>When the dough is smooth, continue kneading it on a floured surface.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for half and hour or until it is double its size.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out and use a round cookie cutter to cut out the doughnuts.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mix and roll the dough out too many times or it will get tough.</li>
<li>Leave the doughnuts to rise for another 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat the oil.</li>
<li>Fry the doughnuts from both sides until they are golden-brown.</li>
<li>Fill the jam into a piping bag with, preferably, a long nozzle.</li>
<li>Use the piping bag to fill the sufganiyah with whatever jam you like best.</li>
<li>Sift the icing sugar over the sufagniyah and they are ready to serve and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Deep Frying: You do not need any special equipment for deep drying. It is possible to just use a large pot filled with enough oil so the pastry is floating. You will be needing a ladle to pick the pastry out of the pot. The oil can be filtered after letting it cooled down. I usually use a coffee filter and store my oil in a closed bottle to later reuse when frying.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Cake is believed to first have been made in Germany, however, this one is made with a mascarpone cream, making it attributable to <strong>Italy</strong>. Coffee cake wasn&#8217;t really invented, it was derived from other cakes. Mascarpone is originally from Italy and even got nominated the P.A.T. (Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale or &#8220;traditional regional food product&#8221;) by the Italian government. This cake is made with a soft biscuit cake base and coffee flavoured mascarpone cream. It tastes similar to Tiramisu but is slightly heavier. It can be enjoyed whenever though it is best served cold so the cream doesn&#8217;t melt.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Biscuit cake: This is a tricky type of cake. It is easy to get something wrong. In fact, I have had huge trouble with it before. Sometimes it is not completely done in the middle. So make sure to do the toothpick trial exactly in the centre and don&#8217;t take the cake out too soon. If you take it out and put it back in too many times, it will collapse and become dry. Make sure the eggs are correctly beaten so you get the right texture. It should be fluffy on the inside.</p>
<p>Coffee: There is a distinct difference in the taste of instant coffee versus a good blend. This coffee&#8217;s main taste is coffee. So it is important to use a good coffee for the soak. Instant coffee is best for cream or the cake itself but I much prefer using coffee made with a coffee machine rather than instant coffee for the soak. It has a stronger more distinct taste to it.</p>
