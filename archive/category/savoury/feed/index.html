					<description><![CDATA[These savoury pumpkin buns are the perfect side for any fall meal! They’re rich in flavour and airy, best served with some butter or cream cheese.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fall has arrived and everyone knows what that means! It is the season of rainy days, Halloween and pumpkin spice. While in some countries getting at the typical orange pumpkins may be hard, this recipe works perfectly well with butternut squash and other roasted gourds. I, for one, used butternut squash and Neapolitan squash. Often, pumpkin is accompanied by the signature blend of spices classified as &#8220;pumpkin spice&#8221;. While many such recipes are sweet, these particular buns are actually rather savoury. The seasonings added to the roasted pumpkin give the buns a light saltiness and combine well with the spices to create a deep and rich flavour.</p>
<p>Here is the recipe. Bake and enjoy!</p>
<p>## Recipe</p>
<p>### **Tools**</p>
<p>This recipe requires kitchen twine (unbleached cotton) to shape the buns.</p>
<p>A pastry brush will be helpful for applying the egg-wash.</p>
<p>### Ingredients</p>
<p>For the roasted pumpkin:</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 small pumpkin</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1-2 Tbsp Olive oil</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
Salt</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
Honey</p>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
360 g all-purpose flour</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
2 tsp instant yeast</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
50 g sugar</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 tsp cinnamon</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1/4 tsp nutmeg</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1/4 tsp ground ginger</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
120 ml warm milk</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
60 g melted butter</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 large egg (plus one extra for egg wash)</p>
<p>### Instructions</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Slice the pumpkin into even wedges and lay out on a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil and season.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Roast the pumpkin in the oven for 35-40 minutes or until soft enough to scrape the flesh from the skin.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Purée the pumpkin using a blender and set aside 120g of the resulting purée for the dough.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Preheat the oven to 190C.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Combine the flour, sugar, instant yeast and spices.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Mix the milk, butter, egg and purée until combined. Make sure the butter is not hot.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, mixing well to combine. This dough will require some kneading and you may have to add some more flour.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Cover and let the dough rise for 1 hour or until doubled.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Shape the buns using kitchen twine by carefully wrapping it around. You can also make simple round buns.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Bake at 190C for 15-18min.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Tap the bottom to know if they’re done. If they sound hollow, they are ready!</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Serve and enjoy!!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you prefer savoury, this recipe is definitely a must try. The crispy filo pastry combined with the creamy filling and the salty feta cheese topping is a perfect orchestra of tastes. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Spanakopita recipe is believed to have been born in <strong>Greece</strong> over 400 years ago. It is similar to the Turkish dish ispanakli. It is a typical dish all across Greece. This savoury delight consists of a filo pastry filled with spinach and different soft cheeses. This recipe uses curd and a feta topping. It is also made with creamed Spinach to give it more moisture. Most chefs will personalise the recipe by adding their own flare. Be it herbs or cheeses, the smallest of changes in ingredients can have a huge impact on the final result. However, some people do not like spinach and, making a huge pie can be a bit much. This recipe is meant to be made in a 3 by 4 standard muffin tray. That way, you have 12 little pies.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Filo dough</li>
<li>250g Frozen Creamed Spinach</li>
<li>300g Curd</li>
<li>200g Feta Cheese</li>
<li>50ml Olive Oil</li>
<li>Salt | Pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Defrost the cream spinach.</li>
<li>Put the olive oil in a large pan and cook the creamed spinach for 5-7 minutes or until it is hot.</li>
<li>Mix the spinach with the curd and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 210ºC.</li>
<li>Next, lay out the dough and cut out circles using either a sharp knife or scrissors.</li>
<li>Put the dough in the holes of a muffin tray.</li>
<li>Fill the dough with the spinach-curd mixture.</li>
<li>Cut thin slices of feta cheese and place them on top of the pies.</li>
<li>Bake the pies for 12-15 minutes.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>You can always add more seasoning to the filling. You can also add diced onions or red bell peppers. If there is a specific type of cheese you prefer to feta or want to add, feel free to.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This delicious savoury cake will be perfect to accompany your picnic. Or maybe you can serve a slice for breakfast? Whatever the occasion, this is a truly marvellous snack.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend brought over fresh figs, just as if she had picked it from a tree on the mountainside facing the Mediterranean sea in <strong>Greece</strong>. I didn&#8217;t have to think long about what to do with them, because this recipe had been sitting in the back of my mind for a while. The crispy salty bacon and the texture of the figs form the perfect harmony. One can only imagine how this treat was enjoyed by the philosophers of old. Add a spoonful of greek yoghurt to serve and enjoy!</p>
<p>Figs are commonly known to be of greek origin, however, figs first originated in Asia and only spread through Europe with the Greeks and Romans. Fig trees can live up to 100 years and grow up to fifty feet, although most only grow 10 to 30 feet. Bacon, on the other hand, was used during the 16th century by the English to refer to all pork. The salted pork however, appeared much earlier in China. Both these star ingredients in the following recipe have an old and elaborate history. This recipe is called a cake, not because it is sweet, but because the texture and the batter are that of a cake. It results in an extremely delicious creation. But, don&#8217;t take my word for it, try it yourself!</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 Eggs</li>
<li>100ml Sunflower Oil</li>
<li>180g Flour</li>
<li>1 package Baking Powder</li>
<li>20ml Milk</li>
<li>100g Greek Yogurt</li>
<li>200g fresh Figs</li>
<li>100g Bacon</li>
<li>100g Emmentaler, grated</li>
<li>Salt | Pepper | Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Put baking paper in a long cake tin and preheat the oven to 180ºC.</li>
<li>Mix the eggs and oil together with an electric mixer until they are fluffy.</li>
<li>Slowly sift in the flour, baking powder and sugar.</li>
<li>Pour in the milk and mix well with an electric mixer to make sure no clumps are left.</li>
<li>Wash the figs and cut them into thin slices.</li>
<li>Cut the bacon into thin strips.</li>
<li>Mix the bacon, figs and cheese into the batter. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>Pour the batter into the cake tin and spread it well.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you want to put a special twist on the known hot dogs? Use this recipe to create something exceptional but still familiar.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who would have thought that hot dogs could possibly be from <strong>China</strong>? Well they originally aren&#8217;t. The commonly known hot dogs first appeared in the USA but the sausages themselves came from Europe. Specifically, they were brought by German immigrants. The name hot dog refers to the &#8216;dachshund&#8217;. The sausage dog. It was first used in Germany as a name for the sausages and was later translated and used to refer to the snack. This recipe, however, will help you make a slightly different and, in my opinion, better version of the hot dog. Instead of sticking a hot sausage between two buns, the sausage is wrapped in yeast dough and covered with sesame before being baked. Super easy to prepare these hand-sized snack rolls make the perfect food to be the star at any picnic or to make school children extra happy with their lunch box.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>10 Wieners</li>
<li>1 small beaten Egg</li>
<li>Sesame Seeds</li>
</ul>
<p>For the dough</p>
<ul>
<li>400g Flour</li>
<li>220ml Water</li>
<li>3Tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>2/3 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>1tsp Salt</li>
<li>3Tbsp Melted Butter</li>
<li>1 small Egg</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Warm the water and mix in the Sugar until disolved.</li>
<li>Crumble in the yeast and integrate it well</li>
<li>Leave the mixture to proof for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix the salt into the flour and form a well in the middle.</li>
<li>Pour in the yeast mixture, the butter, the egg and a bit of the water.</li>
<li>Mix with a fork. Add in the rest of the water.</li>
<li>Use your hands to keep mixing the dough.</li>
<li>Tilt the dough onto a floured surface and keep kneeding until the dough is smooth.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for an hour or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Separate the dough into 10 pieces and roll them out into strips 3 times as long as the sausages.</li>
<li>Wrap the sausages in the dough and leave them to rest for another 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC.</li>
<li>Brush the eggwash over the hot dog buns and sprinkle with sesame.</li>
<li>Bake for 10-15 minutes until they are golden on top.</li>
<li>Take out of the oven and serve hot.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Feel like eating something Italian but not in the mood for a huge, cheese-covered pizza? This recipe is simple and easy to follow and you will have the steaming bread on your plate in a jiffy!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Destination</h2>
<p>Heading to Italy</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Focaccia is a typical Italian recipe believed to have originated before the Roman Empire was formed. Some historians also hold the believe it originated in Ancient Greece. It is important to acknowledge that unrisen flat bread has also long been made throughout the Middle East. However, it can be confirmed that recipes similar to this one can be found in Turkey, France, Spain and Greece. It is also speculated to be the origin of pizza dough. Despite its rich history, it is an easily approachable recipe. It can be varied by adding toppings before baking or filling the finished bread with cheese or ham.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">500g Flour</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">300ml Water</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">60ml Olive Oil (extra for greasing the pan and for the top)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2tsp Sugar</span></li>
<li>2tsp Salt</li>
<li>1package(25g) Fresh Yeast</li>
<li>Sea Salt and Rosemary</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a metal bowl, warm the water until lukewarm and add the sugar. Take the water off the heat. Crumble the yeast into the water and mix well. Let the mixture set for 5-10 minutes to proof the yeast.</li>
<li>Put the flour in a large mixing bowl and add the salt on one side. Pour the yeast mixture on the other side. Try to make sure that yeast and salt don&#8217;t touch directly until it is totally unavoidable! Salt turns yeast off. Add the oil.</li>
<li>Use a fork to mix the mixture until you can knead it by hand. Knead until obtaining a smooth dough.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with a tea towel and let it to rise for 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
<li>When the dough has risen, oil a baking pan and tilt the dough into it. Spread the dough until it is about 2cm thick.</li>
<li>Make deep holes in the dough and fill them with a bit of rosemary. Sprinkle the focaccia with salt and cover it with a tea towel. Leave to rise for another 20 minutes.</li>
<li>When the dough has finished rising, sprinkle a bit of oil over it.</li>
<li>Bake the focaccia on 200ºC for 20 minutes or until golden.</li>
<li>Cut and serve warm with a bit of olive oil and salt.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Focaccia, being bread, can be eaten in a thousand and one ways. With ham and cheese filling or with tomatoes and olives intead of rosemary and salt on top. Anything you like can be added to it. It has a lot of room for your creativity and prefferences.</p>
<p>You can also vary the choice of flour. For example, you can use 250g of spelt flour and 250g of plain flour. That combination is nice with a cheese and onion topping or cherry tomatoes and black olives.</p>
