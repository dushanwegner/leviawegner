					<description><![CDATA[I give you the first in The Caramel Saga. A tale of triumphs and failures, testing and learning.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caramel is a tricky treat that requires lots of precision and attention. Below, I recorded my process and notes on what to improve on next time.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>200g sugar (100%)</li>
<li>optional nuts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In my case, I cut out little leaf shapes.</li>
<li>Heat the sugar in a pot at medium heat. It should reach a temperature between 160-177C.</li>
<li>It took 10 minutes for the sugar to start melting.</li>
<li>7 minutes later, the sugar completely melted and caramelized, ready to be poured out.</li>
<li>Using a pastry brush, I spread some of the caramel on the leaf shapes.</li>
<li>After the caramel has hardened, letting it drop onto the table made it break into pieces.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>First, make sure to spread caramel to get a thin surface. The small shards look like amber pieces and would look great as decoration.<br />
I should test dusting the caramel with starch or powdered sugar to reduce stickiness.<br />
Though a simple recipe and process, this one is a success.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>I did try dusting the caramel with powdered sugar and it did help. Since I used caster sugar, the leaves had a pretty border, as can be seen in the image.</p>
<h3>Watch out! Sharp edges!</h3>

					<description><![CDATA[Autumn, harvest, fall. Whatever you call it, it means apples, cinnamon, carrots and other distinct flavours. What better way to celebrate this season than a carrot cake?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrot cake as we know it today is believed to be from <strong>Persia</strong>, however using carrots in a cake was no unusual practice. Around the 15th century, sugar was scarce and expensive. Not many people could afford to buy and much less use large amounts of sugar. That is when carrots came in. The roots have a sweetness to them that could replace the sugar in the cake. Of course, nowadays we don&#8217;t have to rely on the sweetness of the root, but it still adds a nice flavour to the cake.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Cake base:</p>
<ul>
<li>400g Carrots</li>
<li>85g Crunchy Almonds</li>
<li>100g Flaked Almonds</li>
<li>200g Flour</li>
<li>1tsp Baking Powder</li>
<li>1 pinch Salt</li>
<li>4 Eggs</li>
<li>250g Sugar</li>
<li>100ml Sunflower Oil</li>
<li>5Tbsp Orange Juice</li>
<li>Butter for greasing</li>
</ul>
<p>Topping and decoration:</p>
<ul>
<li>200g Powdered Sugar</li>
<li>5 Tbsp Orange Juice</li>
<li>60g Fondant</li>
<li>Yellow, Red and Blue Food colouring</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wash the carrots, cut their ends and grate them.</li>
<li>Add the almonds to the carrots.</li>
<li>Mix the baking powder and salt into the flour.</li>
<li>Pour the flour into the carrot almond mixture and stir well until the carrots are well coated.</li>
<li>Set the mixture aside and preheat the oven to 160ºC.</li>
<li>Separate the egg yolk from the whites.</li>
<li>Mix the oil, juice and sugar into the egg yolks.</li>
<li>Beat the egg whites until stiff.</li>
<li>Add the egg yolk mixture to the carrots stir well.</li>
<li>Fold in the egg whites.</li>
<li>Pour the batter into a greased cake pan.</li>
<li>Bake the cake for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
</ol>
<p>Decoration and Topping</p>
<ol>
<li>While the cake is in the oven, prepare the decoration.</li>
<li>Separate 40g of fondant from the 60g and add yellow and red until obtaining the desired orange colour.</li>
<li>Add blue and yellow to the remaining 20g. Mix well until the fondant is the correct green colour.</li>
<li>Roll out the fondant. Fold the orange one in half.</li>
<li>Cut six pieces off the orange fondant.</li>
<li>Roll out the green fondant and cut thin strips from it.</li>
<li>Cut triangles into the green fondant and roll it up.</li>
<li>Shape the orange fondant into little carrots and cut thin lines into them.</li>
<li>Wet the base of the leaves and the top of the carrots and put them together. (notes)</li>
<li>Take the cake out of the oven and let it cool.</li>
<li>Mix the juice into the powdered sugar until well integrated.</li>
<li>Let the mixture thicken for a bit before pouring it over the cake.</li>
<li>Place the six carrots on the cake distributed evenly.</li>
<li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Fondant: If the fondant gets too sticky when shaping it, wet it with a bit of water and sprinkle some powdered sugar.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Everyone has heard of this pastry, but many people are scared off by the paper thin outside. Trust me, it is not too difficult and you can definitely pull it off. So give it a try!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This well known pastry was first made by a chef of Catherine Medici of Florence who was Italian but moved to <strong>France</strong> in the year 1540. The dough was first called pâté a Pantanelli or Pantarelli after the chef himself. The pastry evolved and he now used name, choux pastry was given due to it&#8217;s unusual shape after being baked. &#8216;Choux&#8217; is french for cabbage. The dough used for Profiterole can also be used to make other choux pastries such as eclairs. Don&#8217;t be scared off, try it yourself!</p>
<h2>Rezept</h2>

<ul>
<li>100g Butter</li>
<li>240g Water</li>
<li>140g Flour</li>

<li>Mix in the flour and simmer for a minutes before removing it from the heat.</li>
<li>Mix well until the dough resembles that in the picture below.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dough.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-994 " src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dough-300x295.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="368" /></a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Let it cool for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Add in the eggs one at a time and mix thoroughly until the eggs are well incorporated.</li>
<li>Fill the dough into a piping bag with a round nozzle.</li>
<li>Cover a baking tray with baking paper. You can use butter to stick it down so it won&#8217;t curl.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC fan.</li>
<li>Pipe 2cm wide circles onto the paper. Pipe on the same spot without moving the nozzle.</li>
<li>Place the tray in the oven for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Take the tray out and prick the pastries with a sharp knife.</li>
<li>Place the tray back in the oven for another 5-7 minutes.</li>
<li>Leave the shells to cool while you prepare your filling.</li>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Choux pastry: This pastry looks quite tricky and it is definitely a step up from your average lemon loaf or banana bread. Profiterole are not too hard to make, though. There is not as much that can go wrong. It is actually fun to make.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sufganiyot or Sufganiyah (plural) are a delicious dessert that will have everyone's mouth watering. I can assure you, these will fill every little kid's "dessert stomach". Because we all know how much children pride themselves on always having space for sweets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These jelly doughnuts are typical in <strong>Israel</strong>, however similar ones can be found across cultures. The german <em>Berliner</em> or the Spanish and Latin American <em>Buñuelos</em>. The Israeli version is actually derived from the german Berliner which used to be filled with meat rather than jams and jellies. It is only later that these yeast dough doughnuts were filled with jelly and covered with icing sugar. They taste absolutely amazing I can assure you. But, don&#8217;t take my word for it. Try it yourself!</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>50g Sugar</li>
<li>350g Flour</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
<li>25g Butter</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Nutmeg</li>
<li>2 tsp Salt</li>
<li>1 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>180ml Water</li>
<li>Oil for frying</li>
<li>A glass of strawberry or raspberry jam</li>
<li>60g Icing Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Heat the water until it is lukewarm.</li>
<li>Mix one teaspoon of the sugar into the water before crumbling the yeast into the water.</li>
<li>Set the yeast aside for 5 to 10 minutes to proof it. (notes)</li>
<li>Sift the sugar, flour, nutmeg and salt into a bowl.</li>
<li>Rub the butter into the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the dry ingredients and pour in the yeast mixture.</li>
<li>Use a fork to mix everything together until the consistency is sticky enough to knead by hand.</li>
<li>When the dough is smooth, continue kneading it on a floured surface.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for half and hour or until it is double its size.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out and use a round cookie cutter to cut out the doughnuts.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mix and roll the dough out too many times or it will get tough.</li>
<li>Leave the doughnuts to rise for another 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat the oil.</li>
<li>Fry the doughnuts from both sides until they are golden-brown.</li>
<li>Fill the jam into a piping bag with, preferably, a long nozzle.</li>
<li>Use the piping bag to fill the sufganiyah with whatever jam you like best.</li>
<li>Sift the icing sugar over the sufagniyah and they are ready to serve and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Deep Frying: You do not need any special equipment for deep drying. It is possible to just use a large pot filled with enough oil so the pastry is floating. You will be needing a ladle to pick the pastry out of the pot. The oil can be filtered after letting it cooled down. I usually use a coffee filter and store my oil in a closed bottle to later reuse when frying.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Biscuit cake: This is a tricky type of cake. It is easy to get something wrong. In fact, I have had huge trouble with it before. Sometimes it is not completely done in the middle. So make sure to do the toothpick trial exactly in the centre and don&#8217;t take the cake out too soon. If you take it out and put it back in too many times, it will collapse and become dry. Make sure the eggs are correctly beaten so you get the right texture. It should be fluffy on the inside.</p>
<p>Coffee: There is a distinct difference in the taste of instant coffee versus a good blend. This coffee&#8217;s main taste is coffee. So it is important to use a good coffee for the soak. Instant coffee is best for cream or the cake itself but I much prefer using coffee made with a coffee machine rather than instant coffee for the soak. It has a stronger more distinct taste to it.</p>

Other sources claim that crepes first appeared in the year 472 when they were offered to pilgrims visiting Rome. No matter where they first appeared, one thing is certain, and that is that here they are. And they are probably here to stay. It is a loved breakfast or even dessert and it is quite simple to make.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are looking for a sweet snack, I've got you. This recipe makes absolutely delicious Malasadas. A type of Hawaiian donuts. Go ahead! Try it!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Picture the beautiful flowing hills and mountains of <strong>Hawaii</strong>. The beautiful beaches. But what of the culture? Nowadays, our knowledge of the Hawaiian culture is twisted by common misconceptions. For example, people born or living on the islands are not automatically Hawaiians. Hawaiians can trace their roots to the original inhabitants of the islands. Another common misunderstanding is that &#8216;Aloha&#8217; is equivalent to &#8216;Hello&#8217;. This is not in fact true as Aloha is more a way of life in general than a greeting and translates as &#8216;joyfully sharing life&#8217;. The frequently celebrated Luau&#8217;s are not in fact for the Hawaiians. They are not regularly celebrated by the residents.</p>
<p>When it comes to Hawaiian food, much of it is derived from recipes brought there by immigrants. Malasadas are believed to have first originated in Sao Miguel, an island in the Azores. They were later introduced in Hawaii and are now seen as a Hawaiian speciality. They are a common treat and can be found in most bakeries there. The name Malasadas means &#8220;poorly cooked&#8221;, which refers to the texture and crispy exterior of the pastry. It can be eaten with a custard filling or with ice cream, coated in sugar or not coated. It is easily adaptable to every person&#8217;s taste.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Deep Frying: You do not need any special equipment for deep drying. It is possible to just use a large pot filled with enough oil so the pastry is floating. You will be needing a ladle to pick the pastry out of the pot. The oil can be filtered after letting it cooled down. I usually use a coffee filter and store my oil in a closed bottle to later reuse when frying.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>
