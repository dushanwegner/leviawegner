										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know, Crepes were not originally only a breakfast food in <strong>France</strong>? In fact, they were used like bread. In french folklore, the origin is set in the 13th century. It is remembered as a happy accident. A housewife spilling porridge onto a cooking stone. Other sources claim that crepes first appeared in the year 472 when they were offered to pilgrims visiting Rome. No matter where they first appeared, one thing is certain, and that is that here they are. And they are probably here to stay. It is a loved breakfast or even dessert and it is quite simple to make.</p>
