					<description><![CDATA[These savoury pumpkin buns are the perfect side for any fall meal! They’re rich in flavour and airy, best served with some butter or cream cheese.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fall has arrived and everyone knows what that means! It is the season of rainy days, Halloween and pumpkin spice. While in some countries getting at the typical orange pumpkins may be hard, this recipe works perfectly well with butternut squash and other roasted gourds. I, for one, used butternut squash and Neapolitan squash. Often, pumpkin is accompanied by the signature blend of spices classified as &#8220;pumpkin spice&#8221;. While many such recipes are sweet, these particular buns are actually rather savoury. The seasonings added to the roasted pumpkin give the buns a light saltiness and combine well with the spices to create a deep and rich flavour.</p>
<p>Here is the recipe. Bake and enjoy!</p>
<p>## Recipe</p>
<p>### **Tools**</p>
<p>This recipe requires kitchen twine (unbleached cotton) to shape the buns.</p>
<p>A pastry brush will be helpful for applying the egg-wash.</p>
<p>### Ingredients</p>
<p>For the roasted pumpkin:</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 small pumpkin</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1-2 Tbsp Olive oil</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
Salt</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
Honey</p>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
360 g all-purpose flour</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
2 tsp instant yeast</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
50 g sugar</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 tsp cinnamon</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1/4 tsp nutmeg</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1/4 tsp ground ginger</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
120 ml warm milk</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
60 g melted butter</p>
<p> 	&#8211;<br />
1 large egg (plus one extra for egg wash)</p>
<p>### Instructions</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Slice the pumpkin into even wedges and lay out on a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil and season.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Roast the pumpkin in the oven for 35-40 minutes or until soft enough to scrape the flesh from the skin.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Purée the pumpkin using a blender and set aside 120g of the resulting purée for the dough.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Preheat the oven to 190C.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Combine the flour, sugar, instant yeast and spices.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Mix the milk, butter, egg and purée until combined. Make sure the butter is not hot.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, mixing well to combine. This dough will require some kneading and you may have to add some more flour.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Cover and let the dough rise for 1 hour or until doubled.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Shape the buns using kitchen twine by carefully wrapping it around. You can also make simple round buns.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Bake at 190C for 15-18min.</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Tap the bottom to know if they’re done. If they sound hollow, they are ready!</p>
<p> 	&#8211; Serve and enjoy!!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[An amazing treat to finalise your dinner? The perfect breakfast pastry? Well, this is the recipe for you. But don't take my name for it, try it yourself!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the many rumours revolving around this pastry from the <strong>USA</strong>, there is one tale that is most widely accepted. Allegedly, a baker in Boston got mad and tossed a batch of unfinished rolls in the oven. You can imagine everyone&#8217;s surprise when the result was so absolutely delicious. Of course, dinner rolls can be enjoyed at any time of the day. Be it a roll with jam and butter for breakfast or a honey-topped roll for dinner.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>240ml Soy Milk</li>
<li>1 package Fresh Yeast (notes)</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>60g Ghee</li>
<li>400g Wholegrain Flour</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Topping</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Tbsp Ghee</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Honey</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Warm the soy milk and mix in the sugar.</li>
<li>Take the soy milk off the stove and crumble in the yeast. (notes)</li>
<li>Let the yeast proof for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Rub the Ghee into the flour until obtaining a crumbly texture.</li>
<li>Crack one of the eggs into the flour and add in the yeast mixture.</li>
<li>Use a fork to stir until a dough starts to form.</li>
<li>Start kneading with your hands.</li>
<li>Tilt the dough onto a clean surface and keep kneading.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Punch the dough down and divide it into about 14-16 pieces.</li>
<li>Place the rolls into a square glass tray and let them rise for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC.</li>
<li>Beat the egg with a fork before using a pastry brush to apply the egg-wash to the pastry.</li>
<li>Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden on top.</li>
<li>Melt the butter and mix in the honey.</li>
<li>Separate the rolls from each other.</li>
<li>Brush with honey topping and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="p1">Fresh Yeast: When using fresh yeast, the package usually specifies the yeast to flour ratio. It can be different for different brands of yeast. The yeast I usually use comes in packages of 25g and is used for 500g of flour. If you prefer to use active dry yeast, check the back of the package. I usually use two packages of active dry yeast instead of one package of fresh yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">Yeast: First of all make sure the water is not too hot. It should not be burning. It should be merely warm not hot. If your yeast mixture is not puffy after you let it proof for five minutes, try leaving it for another five. If it still isn&#8217;t puffy, do not continue with that mixture!!! It will take less time to redo the yeast mixture and get it right than it will to remake the entire dough because it didn&#8217;t rise. Yeast is a tricky ingredient to work with and much can go wrong. This is a way of catching any mistakes early on and sparing yourself a lot of work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sufganiyot or Sufganiyah (plural) are a delicious dessert that will have everyone's mouth watering. I can assure you, these will fill every little kid's "dessert stomach". Because we all know how much children pride themselves on always having space for sweets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These jelly doughnuts are typical in <strong>Israel</strong>, however similar ones can be found across cultures. The german <em>Berliner</em> or the Spanish and Latin American <em>Buñuelos</em>. The Israeli version is actually derived from the german Berliner which used to be filled with meat rather than jams and jellies. It is only later that these yeast dough doughnuts were filled with jelly and covered with icing sugar. They taste absolutely amazing I can assure you. But, don&#8217;t take my word for it. Try it yourself!</p>

<li>Rub the butter into the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the dry ingredients and pour in the yeast mixture.</li>

<li>When the dough is smooth, continue kneading it on a floured surface.</li>
<li>Leave the dough to rise for half and hour or until it is double its size.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out and use a round cookie cutter to cut out the doughnuts.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mix and roll the dough out too many times or it will get tough.</li>
<li>Leave the doughnuts to rise for another 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat the oil.</li>

<p class="p1">Deep Frying: You do not need any special equipment for deep drying. It is possible to just use a large pot filled with enough oil so the pastry is floating. You will be needing a ladle to pick the pastry out of the pot. The oil can be filtered after letting it cooled down. I usually use a coffee filter and store my oil in a closed bottle to later reuse when frying.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are looking for a sweet snack, I've got you. This recipe makes absolutely delicious Malasadas. A type of Hawaiian donuts. Go ahead! Try it!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Picture the beautiful flowing hills and mountains of <strong>Hawaii</strong>. The beautiful beaches. But what of the culture? Nowadays, our knowledge of the Hawaiian culture is twisted by common misconceptions. For example, people born or living on the islands are not automatically Hawaiians. Hawaiians can trace their roots to the original inhabitants of the islands. Another common misunderstanding is that &#8216;Aloha&#8217; is equivalent to &#8216;Hello&#8217;. This is not in fact true as Aloha is more a way of life in general than a greeting and translates as &#8216;joyfully sharing life&#8217;. The frequently celebrated Luau&#8217;s are not in fact for the Hawaiians. They are not regularly celebrated by the residents.</p>
<p>When it comes to Hawaiian food, much of it is derived from recipes brought there by immigrants. Malasadas are believed to have first originated in Sao Miguel, an island in the Azores. They were later introduced in Hawaii and are now seen as a Hawaiian speciality. They are a common treat and can be found in most bakeries there. The name Malasadas means &#8220;poorly cooked&#8221;, which refers to the texture and crispy exterior of the pastry. It can be eaten with a custard filling or with ice cream, coated in sugar or not coated. It is easily adaptable to every person&#8217;s taste.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though, these specific doughnuts are from <strong>Nigeria</strong>, donuts actually originated in the Netherlands. As far back as the 19th century, the Dutch have been making &#8220;olykoeks&#8221; or &#8220;oil cakes&#8221;. But even before that, doughnuts might have appeared in Asian cuisine. Even the Greeks and Roman fried dough and coated in sugar. Even the Arab&#8217;s had their variation of dough fritters. It seems all across the globe, people enjoyed (and still do) fried dough pastries. Be it coated in sugar or with chocolate or other toppings. It is no wonder, there is a variant made in Nigeria. Wherever they are from, doughnuts are a delicious snack.</p>

<li>Roll the rest of the dough into a ball and leave to rest for another 20 minutes or while you fry the first batch. (Try not to reuse the scraps too many times or your donuts will be rough.)</li>
<li>Heat up some sunflower oil in a pot and fry you dounuts until golden brown.</li>
<li>Place them shortly on some kitchen paper and then sift them in sugar.</li>
<li>Repeat this process with the donut middles.</li>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Focaccia is a typical Italian recipe believed to have originated before the Roman Empire was formed. Some historians also hold the believe it originated in Ancient Greece. It is important to acknowledge that unrisen flat bread has also long been made throughout the Middle East. However, it can be confirmed that recipes similar to this one can be found in Turkey, France, Spain and Greece. It is also speculated to be the origin of pizza dough. Despite its rich history, it is an easily approachable recipe. It can be varied by adding toppings before baking or filling the finished bread with cheese or ham.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you feeling like travelling to Germany without leaving your own kitchen? These delicious apple rolls are exactly what you need. Spiced with a bit of cinnamon or filled with plums or raisins, they can easily be adapted to fit everyones likes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Destination</h2>
<p>Heading to <em><strong>Germany</strong></em></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Apple Rolls are pretty similar to cinnamon rolls when it comes to the dough but they differ in the filling. There are many ways to give this recipe a personal twist. Apfel-Rosinen-Schnecken are typically eaten in Germany. They are made with yeast dough and apple compot. Yeast dough is quite tricky when getting started but it becomes easier and even fun to make it the more times you do it.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>For the dough</p>
<ul>
<li>500g Flour</li>
<li>250ml Milk</li>
<li>75g Butter</li>
<li>25g fresh Yeast</li>
<li>70g Sugar</li>
<li>1 package Vanilla Sugar</li>
<li>pinch of Salt</li>
</ul>
<p>For the filling</p>
<ul>
<li>500g of Apples (5 small apples)</li>
<li>100g of Brown Sugar</li>
<li>optional: Cinnamon, Raisins, Plums</li>
</ul>
<p>For the topping</p>
<ul>
<li>64g Powdered Sugar</li>
<li>1Tbsp Milk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>1- Cut the apples and place them on a baking tray covering them with the sugar, leaving them to soak.</p>
<p>2- Warm the milk and place the butter inside. When melted, add sugar, vanilla sugar and a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>3- Remove the mixture from the heat and crumble the fresh yeast, adding it to the mixture and stirring thoroughly.</p>
<p>4- Add the milk-yeast mixture to the flour and knead it until obtaining a homogenous dough.</p>
<p>5- Cover the dough and let it rise for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>6- Cover a large area with flour and roll out the dough forming a rectangle.</p>
<p>7- Blend the apples until obtaining a consisten compot.</p>
<p>8- Spread the compot on the dough.</p>
<p>9- Roll up the dough and cut it into 4cm thick rolls.</p>
<p>10- Place the rolls on the baking tray with the cut side up.</p>
<p>11- Cover the tray and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes.</p>
<p>12- Heat the oven to 250ºC and bake the apple rolls for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>11- Mix the powdered sugar with the milk and spread it over the apple rolls.</p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Cinnamon- Looking to spice the apple compot with cinnamon? No problem. Sprinkle some cinnamon on the apples before leaving them to soak.</p>
<p>Raisins &#8211; Raisins and Apples go hand in hand in many recipes. I haven&#8217;t included them in the recipe itself but you can add them into the apple compot before spreading it on the dough.</p>
<p>Plums &#8211; If you want to add a plum centre, align plums on the side from which you will roll up the dough. That way, your apple rolls will have a nice plum centre.</p>
